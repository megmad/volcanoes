    <h3> Active Volcanoes </h3>
    <p> Volcanoes are a very interesting topic. Many people may be scared but there is not much to worry about. Most of the volcanoes on this planet are not active and even the ones that are, don't erupt very often, and even when they do, they dont have enormous explosions like the ones we see in movies. Although most volcanoes are not very scary, there are still a few that are like the ones we imagine when we think of a volcano. This is what we are going to talk about today.  </p>
